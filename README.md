# WolfTicket
The WolfTickets program is an implementation of an IT ticketing system, where users could submit tickets representing problems that need fixing, which can then be "checked off" after they're resolved.

# To run the program:
1) Run program as a java application.
2) You can either add your own groups and tickets, or load from a previously made file of groups and tickets.

3) To run it with your own inputs of groups and tickets: Click "File" in the top left, click **"New Group"** to add a group, and then the users can start adding tickets to that group.
4) To run with a previously made file of groups and tickets: Click "File" in the top left, click **"Load Group"** --> **"test-files"** --> **"group1.txt"** to load the group and tickets.

   Program should look like this:
